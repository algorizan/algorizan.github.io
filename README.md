## Purpose

These instructions will give you a copy of the project up and running on
your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment
for notes on deploying the project on a live system.

## Prerequisites
This should include a resume formatted in Markdown
- Include a link to a good Markdown tutorial under "More Resources." You do not need to explain how to use Markdown.


## Instructions
- Use headings and numbered lists
- Remember to use each step to explain both how to follow the tools and model Etter recommends and how to host a resume in GitHub Pages or Codeberg Pages. It's up to you whether you 1) begin with Etter's general process and then demonstrate the process with a practical step involving your resume, or 2) begin with the practical steps for hosting a resume and relate each practical step to a concept in Etter's book.
- Add an animated gif: Include a demo using an animated gif in your README. The gif should feature your own resume (showing your own name).

### Create the README File
-> Etter's concept = Use Lightweight Markup

### Upload to GitHub
-> Etter's concept = Use Distributed Version Control

###

## More Resources
Include a Markdown tutorial and at least three other resources.

    - You may use the example FAQs, or come up with your own.
