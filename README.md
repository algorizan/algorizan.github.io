# Hosting Your Resume on GitHub Pages: A Beginner's Guide

## Purpose

These instructions will show you how to host your personal resume or CV on GitHub Pages with a static file website generator.
This guide will also relate each practical step to the general principles of Andrew Etter's book Modern Technical Writing.

## Prerequisites
<!-- This should include a resume formatted in Markdown
- Include a link to a good Markdown tutorial under "More Resources." You do not need to explain how to use Markdown. -->
- **GitHub Account**: If you haven't yet, create a [GitHub account](https://github.com/join).
- **Text Editor**: Use a text editor of your choice.
    - This guide will use [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/).
- **Resume**: You'll need your resume formatted in Markdown.
    - Learn about [GitHub Flavoured Markdown](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github).
- **Git**: have git set up with your text editor.
    - Learn [how to do it on VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/sourcecontrol/intro-to-git).


## Instructions <!-- TODO -->
<!--
- Use headings and numbered lists
- Remember to use each step to explain both how to follow the tools and model Etter recommends and how to host a resume in GitHub Pages or Codeberg Pages. It's up to you whether you 1) begin with Etter's general process and then demonstrate the process with a practical step involving your resume, or 2) begin with the practical steps for hosting a resume and relate each practical step to a concept in Etter's book.
- Add an animated gif: Include a demo using an animated gif in your README. The gif should feature your own resume (showing your own name).

### Step 1: Create the README and Resume Files <!-- TODO -->
<!-- Etter's concept = Use Lightweight Markup -->

Firstly, using Andrew Etter's concept of "using Lightweight Markup", we are going to create our README file and resume using GitHub Flavoured Markdown.

1. Create a file called `README.md` in the top level (root) of your directory.
2. Add a title and a short paragraph describing the purpose of your project (i.e., hosting your resume).
3. Save your README file for now, you can add anything else you want later on.
4. Create a new file for your resume, but name it `index.md`. This is so that GitHub knows this is the file you want to host as your website's main page.
5. Add all your resume information to the `index.md` file in GitHub Flavoured Markdown and save it. Don't worry about making it perfect now, you'll be able to edit it as much as you want later.

### Step 2: Upload to GitHub <!-- TODO -->
<!-- Etter's concept = Use Distributed Version Control -->

Next, we will upload our project to GitHub, will relates to the concept of "using distributed version control" in Etter's book.

2. Create a [new repository](https://github.com/new) in your GitHub account named `username.github.io`, where "username" is your actual GitHub username.
