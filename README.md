# Hosting Your Resume on GitHub Pages: A Beginner's Guide

## Purpose

These instructions will show you how to host your personal resume or CV on GitHub Pages with a static file website generator.
This guide will also relate each practical step to the general principles of Andrew Etter's book Modern Technical Writing.

## Prerequisites <!-- TODO -->
This should include a resume formatted in Markdown
- Include a link to a good Markdown tutorial under "More Resources." You do not need to explain how to use Markdown.


## Instructions <!-- TODO -->
- Use headings and numbered lists
- Remember to use each step to explain both how to follow the tools and model Etter recommends and how to host a resume in GitHub Pages or Codeberg Pages. It's up to you whether you 1) begin with Etter's general process and then demonstrate the process with a practical step involving your resume, or 2) begin with the practical steps for hosting a resume and relate each practical step to a concept in Etter's book.
- Add an animated gif: Include a demo using an animated gif in your README. The gif should feature your own resume (showing your own name).
